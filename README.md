# PAYDAY2-Meme-Rebalace
Rebalance mod for PAYDAY2 that spawned from a very old version of Blaze Rebalance.
Not really intended for general use, more just a few people screwing around because we can. High probablity of being broken at any given time, and has at least a 5% chance of containing a potentially game-crashing bug that we missed. If you choose to download this mod, you do so at your own risk and acknowledge that we have ZERO liability for any broken save files, game crashes, (unlikely) hardware failure, etc.
